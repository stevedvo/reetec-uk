	<h3 class="BodyTitle">Inspection & Testing Services</h3>
	<p>Reetec Electrical Services offers a full range of inspection and testing services on both fixed and portable equipment for domestic, commercial and industrial installations.</p>
	<p>All installations will deteriorate with age and legislation requires that all electrical installations are maintained in a safe condition and therefore must be periodically inspected. Properties should be inspected at the change of occupancy or within a set yearly period for the type of property.</p>

	<p>We recognise the importance of testing and inspection, and have invested in the latest test equipment and computer software to ensure these services are carried out to the highest standard.</p>
	<p>Testing is carried out using modern regularly calibrated test equipment. Results are logged onto a computer database where NICEIC reports and certificates can be saved for future reference and then printed off and issued to the client who ordered the initial works.</p>
